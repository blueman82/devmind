# DevMind Swift App - TODO List

## Phase 2 Status: 95% Complete (Ready for Testing)

### âœ… Completed Tasks
- [x] Created 5 complete UI windows with mock data
- [x] Fixed 12 compilation errors (color compatibility, Hashable conformance)
- [x] Resolved runtime crash (AppState singleton issue)
- [x] Implemented window management with duplicate prevention
- [x] Added hover effects and animations
- [x] Code review completed (Grade: B+)

### ðŸ§ª Immediate Testing Required (5% Remaining)
- [ ] Build and run app in Xcode (âŒ˜R)
- [ ] Verify brain icon appears in menu bar
- [ ] Test dropdown menu with 4 items
- [ ] Open each window and verify sizes
- [ ] Check hover effects and animations
- [ ] Verify connection status animation
- [ ] Test duplicate window prevention
- [ ] Apply Echo logo (optional)

## Phase 3: MCP Integration (Next Phase)

### Core Tasks
- [ ] Create ProcessManager.swift for Node.js spawning
- [ ] Implement MCPClient.swift for JSON-RPC communication
- [ ] Connect SearchWindow to search_conversations tool
- [ ] Connect MainBrowser to list_recent_conversations tool
- [ ] Connect RestorePoints to list_restore_points tool
- [ ] Replace all mock data with live MCP calls

### Error Handling Implementation
- [ ] Connection error states for MCP server
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- [ ] User feedback for errors
- [ ] Graceful degradation when server unavailable

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Unit tests for AppState
- [ ] Integration tests for MCP communication
- [ ] UI tests for window management

## Known Issues to Address

### Easy Fixes
1. **Missing Documentation Comments**
   - Add Swift documentation comments to all public methods
   - Priority: Low
   - Effort: 1-2 hours

2. **Mock Data Extraction**
   - Move mock data to separate files/extensions
   - Priority: Low
   - Effort: 30 minutes

### Medium Difficulty
3. **Error Handling (Phase 3)**
   - No error states in current UI
   - Add error alerts for MCP failures
   - Priority: High
   - Effort: 2-3 hours

4. **File Size Optimization**
   - Some views exceed 200 lines (SettingsWindow: 475 lines)
   - Extract sub-components into separate files
   - Priority: Medium
   - Effort: 2-3 hours

5. **Search Debouncing**
   - Implement debouncing for search input
   - Priority: Medium
   - Effort: 1-2 hours

### Hard Tasks
6. **Testing Coverage**
   - Currently 0% test coverage
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Priority: High (for Phase 3)
   - Effort: 1-2 days

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider virtualization for large lists
   - Cache window instances
   - Priority: Medium
   - Effort: 1 day

8. **Security Hardening (Phase 3)**
   - MCP server authentication
   - Secure IPC communication
   - Keychain storage for credentials
   - Priority: High
   - Effort: 2-3 days

## Project Workflow Rules
- âœ… Maintain 500-line file limit
- âœ… Commit after every change
- âœ… Update progress documentation
- âœ… Test before moving forward

## Next Session Goals
1. Complete Phase 2 testing (5-10 minutes)
2. Begin Phase 3 MCP integration
3. Start with ProcessManager.swift implementation
