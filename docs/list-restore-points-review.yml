# Performance Analysis
performance_assessment:
  overall_rating: "VERY GOOD"
  
  optimizations:
    query_efficiency:
      - "Single prepared statement for repository lookup"
      - "Efficient LEFT JOIN instead of N+1 queries"
      - "LIMIT clause to control result size"
      - "ORDER BY with DESC for recent-first results"
    
    database_access:
      - "Lazy initialization of database"
      - "Reuses existing dbManager connection"
      - "Single round-trip for restore points"
    
  suggestions:
    statement_caching:
      issue: "Prepared statements created on each call"
      recommendation: "Cache statements at class level"
      impact: "Minor performance improvement"

# Database Query Analysis
