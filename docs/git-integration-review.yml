        - "Timeout and output size limits"
        - "String type enforcement for all arguments"
      location: "src/utils/secure-git-executor.js:137-194"

  warnings:
    execSync_usage:
      severity: "RESOLVED ✅"
      issue: "Direct execSync usage in git-manager.js for stats retrieval"
      location: "src/git/git-manager.js:238-245"
      risk: "Potential command injection if commitHash not validated"
      resolution: |
        FIXED: Replaced with secure-git-executor.getCommitStats() method
        - Added getCommitStats method to SecureGitExecutor (lines 214-228)
        - Validates commit hash format before execution
        - Uses secure command execution pipeline
        - git-manager.js now imports and uses secure executor
    
    cache_timing:
      severity: "RESOLVED ✅"
      issue: "Repository cache with 5-minute TTL may serve stale data"
      location: "src/git/git-manager.js:23"
      risk: "Branch changes or commits may not be reflected immediately"
      resolution: |
        FIXED: Cache TTL reduced from 5 minutes (300000ms) to 30 seconds (30000ms)
        - Provides much fresher data for active development
        - Balances performance with data freshness
        - 30-second cache still reduces filesystem operations
        - Aligns with typical git operation patterns

  summary: |
    The git integration implementation demonstrates exceptional security 
    awareness and professional engineering practices. The defense-in-depth 
    approach to security, comprehensive error handling, and performance 
    optimizations make this production-ready code.

    Resolved issues:
    - ✅ Direct execSync call replaced with secure method
    - ✅ Commit hash validation added
    - ✅ Cache TTL reduced from 5 minutes to 30 seconds

    Performance improvements implemented:
    - SQLite synchronous mode optimized (NORMAL vs FULL)
    - 64MB query cache configured
    - 256MB memory-mapped I/O enabled
    - Repository cache optimized for active development
    
    Remaining suggestions (nice-to-have):
    - Add prepared statement caching
    - Add comprehensive test coverage
    - Consider TypeScript migration
