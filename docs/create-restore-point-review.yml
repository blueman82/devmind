# Final Assessment
final_assessment:
  grade: "A+"
  summary: |
    The create_restore_point implementation is exceptional with robust
    error handling, comprehensive validation, and excellent user experience.
    The auto-discovery feature and detailed error messages make it very
    user-friendly while maintaining high security standards.
    
    Key strengths:
    - Comprehensive input validation and security
    - Auto-discovery and indexing of repositories
    - Robust duplicate prevention
    - Excellent error messages with guidance
    - Rich response with full context
