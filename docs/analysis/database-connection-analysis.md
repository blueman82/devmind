# Database Connection Pooling Analysis

## Current Architecture Assessment

**Database Library**: better-sqlite3 v11.5.0
**Architecture**: Single-threaded Node.js application  
**Concurrency Model**: WAL mode enabled for better concurrency

## Connection Usage Patterns

1. **FileWatcher**: Creates 1 DatabaseManager instance, long-lived
2. **MCP Server**: Creates 1 DatabaseManager instance, long-lived  
3. **Monitor Dashboard**: Creates 1 DatabaseManager instance, short-lived
4. **Status Tool**: Creates 1 DatabaseManager instance, short-lived

## Analysis Results

### Connection Pooling Assessment: NOT NEEDED

**Reasoning**:
- better-sqlite3 is designed for single-threaded Node.js applications
- No traditional connection pooling like PostgreSQL/MySQL
- WAL mode already provides improved concurrency for multiple processes
- Current usage pattern doesn't show high-concurrency access patterns

### Performance Optimizations Available

**Current Optimizations**:
- ✅ WAL mode enabled (`journal_mode = WAL`)
- ✅ Foreign keys enabled for data integrity
- ✅ FTS5 for optimized full-text search

**Recommended Additional Optimizations**:
- Add `synchronous = NORMAL` for better performance
- Add `cache_size = -64000` (64MB cache)
- Add `mmap_size = 268435456` (256MB memory mapping)

## Recommendation

The code review warning about "connection pooling" is not applicable to better-sqlite3. However, we can add performance optimizations to the database initialization.

**Action**: Add performance pragmas instead of connection pooling
**Impact**: Better performance without architectural changes
**Risk**: Low - these are standard SQLite performance optimizations
