tool_overview:
  name: "preview_restore"
  purpose: "Preview what would change if restoring to a specific restore point or commit"
  location: "src/mcp-server/handlers/git-tool-handlers.js:767-1146"

  status: "NEEDS SECURITY FIX"

# CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE
critical_security_issue:
  severity: "HIGH"
  issue: "Git diff command not whitelisted in secure-git-executor"
  location: "lines 1111-1115"
  code: |
    const diffSummary = secureGitExecutor.executeGitCommand(
      'diff',
      ['--name-status', `${fromCommit}..${toCommit}`],
      { cwd: projectPath, timeout: 10000 }
    );
  problem: |
    The 'diff' command is NOT in the allowedCommands Set in secure-git-executor.
    Current allowed commands: ['remote', 'branch', 'log', 'show', 'status', 'rev-parse', 'config']
    This will cause the command to fail with "Git command 'diff' is not allowed"
  
  required_fix: |
    Add 'diff' to the allowedCommands Set in secure-git-executor.js:
    ```javascript
    this.allowedCommands = new Set([
      'remote',
      'branch', 
      'log',
      'show',
      'status',
      'rev-parse',
      'config',
      'diff'  // ADD THIS
    ]);
    ```
    
    And add allowed subcommands:
    ```javascript
    ['diff', new Set(['--name-status', '--stat', '--numstat'])]
    ```

# Final Assessment
final_assessment:
  grade: "B+" # Would be A after security fix
  summary: |
    The preview_restore implementation is well-designed with comprehensive
    functionality and good user experience. However, it has a critical
    security issue where the git diff command is not whitelisted, causing
    the fallback mechanism to fail.
    
    Critical issue:
    - Git diff command not in allowed commands list
    
    Minor issues:
    - Missing validation for user-provided commit_hash
    - Incomplete test coverage
    
    Strengths:
    - Comprehensive preview information
    - Excellent user guidance with restore commands
    - Smart fallback mechanism (once fixed)
    - Good warning system for uncommitted changes
    - Well-structured response format
    
    Once the git diff security issue is resolved, this will be
    production-ready code with excellent functionality.
  
  production_readiness: "NOT READY - Fix security issue first"
  security_posture: "GOOD (after fix)"
  performance_profile: "OPTIMIZED"
  maintainability_score: "HIGH"
  user_experience: "EXCELLENT"
