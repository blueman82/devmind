  input_validation:
    parameter_validation:
      status: "✅ SECURE"
      implementation:
        - "Required project_path validation"
        - "Either restore_point_id or commit_hash required"
        - "Path validation through pathValidator"

    user_guidance:
      - "Provides safe restore commands"
      - "Includes stash option for uncommitted changes"
      - "Shows backup branch creation command"
      - "Clear warnings about potential data loss"

    approach: "Database-first with git fallback"
    strengths:
      - "Efficient database query for indexed data"
      - "Proper file grouping and change detection"
      - "Fallback to git diff when needed"
    issues:
      - "Git diff fallback will fail due to security restriction"
      - "No line count statistics from database query"
  
  preview_generation:
    completeness: "EXCELLENT"
    includes:
      - "Restore point metadata"
      - "Current repository state"
      - "Target commit information"
