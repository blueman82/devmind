# WARNINGS (Should Fix)
warnings:
  - id: "W001"
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    category: "Performance/Reliability"
    title: "Aggressive timeout handling in file system operations"
    location: "monitor-indexer.js:113-120"
    description: |
      File system operations wrapped in Promise.race() with 2-3 second timeouts
      may cause premature failures on slow file systems or during high I/O load.
    code_snippet: |
      await Promise.race([
          fs.access(watcher.claudeProjectsPath),
          new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Timeout')), 2000))
      ]);
    risk_assessment: "Medium - May cause false negatives on slower systems"
    fix_recommendation: |
      Make timeout values configurable and increase defaults:
      ```javascript
      const CONFIG = {
          FILE_ACCESS_TIMEOUT: process.env.FILE_ACCESS_TIMEOUT || 5000,
          DIRECTORY_READ_TIMEOUT: process.env.DIR_READ_TIMEOUT || 8000
      };
      
      await Promise.race([
          fs.access(watcher.claudeProjectsPath),
          new Promise((_, reject) => 
              setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Directory access timeout')), CONFIG.FILE_ACCESS_TIMEOUT))
      ]);
      ```

  - id: "W002"
    severity: "LOW"
    category: "Error Handling"
    title: "Database initialization not guaranteed before tool use"
    location: "src/mcp-server/handlers/tool-handlers.js:11-31"
    description: |
      ToolHandlers constructor initializes database asynchronously but doesn't
      guarantee completion before tools are called, potentially causing runtime errors.
    risk_assessment: "Low - Current usage patterns appear safe, but could cause issues under load"
    fix_recommendation: |
      Add database connection validation before operations:
      ```javascript
      async ensureDatabase() {
          if (!this.isDbInitialized) {
              await this.initializeDatabase();
          }
          if (!this.dbManager?.isInitialized) {
              throw new Error('Database not available');
          }
      }
      
      // Call before each tool operation
      await this.ensureDatabase();
      ```

  - id: "W003"
    severity: "LOW"
    category: "Debugging/Production"
    title: "Debug logging in production code"
    location: "monitor-indexer.js:47, 52, 55, 75, 105, 151"
    description: |
      Recent debug console.log statements added for troubleshooting should be
      removed or made conditional for production deployment.
    code_snippet: |
      console.log('[DEBUG] Starting displayStatus...');
      console.log('[DEBUG] Basic setup complete...');
    risk_assessment: "Low - Cosmetic issue, may clutter production logs"
    fix_recommendation: |
      Replace with conditional logging:
      ```javascript
      const DEBUG = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
      const debug = (...args) => DEBUG && console.log('[DEBUG]', ...args);
      
      debug('Starting displayStatus...');
      ```

# SUGGESTIONS (Consider Improving)
suggestions:

    category: "Security/Validation"
    title: "Enhanced input validation for MCP tool parameters"
    location: "src/mcp-server/mcp-server.js:42-100"
    description: |
      While schema validation exists, additional runtime validation would
      provide better security and user experience.
    benefit: "Enhanced security against malformed inputs and better error messages"
    implementation: |
      ```javascript
      validateSearchQuery(query) {
          if (!query || typeof query !== 'string') {
              throw new Error('Query must be a non-empty string');
          }
          if (query.trim().length === 0) {
              throw new Error('Query cannot be empty or only whitespace');
          }
          if (query.length > 1000) {
              throw new Error('Query too long (maximum 1000 characters)');
          }
          // Sanitize potential SQL injection attempts
          if (query.includes('--') || query.includes(';')) {
              console.warn('Potentially unsafe query characters detected:', query);
          }
      }
      ```

    category: "Maintainability"
    title: "Extract magic numbers and configuration constants"
    location: "monitor-indexer.js:113-120, 174"
    description: |
      Hardcoded values throughout the codebase reduce maintainability
      and make testing/configuration more difficult.

    title: "Implement structured logging with levels"
    location: "Throughout codebase"
    description: |
      Current console.log approach limits production monitoring and debugging capabilities.
      Structured logging would improve operational visibility.
    benefit: "Better production debugging, monitoring, and alerting capabilities"

    description: |
      Repeated searches and conversation lookups could benefit from
      intelligent caching to reduce database load.
    benefit: "Improved response times for repeated queries and reduced database load"
