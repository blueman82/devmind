  summary: |
    The restore_project_state implementation is exceptionally well-designed with
    a strong focus on safety and user control. The tool successfully balances
    power with protection, providing advanced restoration capabilities while
    preventing accidental data loss.
    
    Key strengths:
    - Never executes commands directly - user maintains control
    - Multiple safety mechanisms (backup, stash, warnings)
    - Comprehensive input validation and security
    - Clear, actionable command generation
    - Excellent edge case handling
    - Smart integration with restore points
    
    The implementation demonstrates mature software engineering practices
    with its fail-safe design, clear separation of concerns, and focus on
    user safety. This is production-ready code of the highest quality.
