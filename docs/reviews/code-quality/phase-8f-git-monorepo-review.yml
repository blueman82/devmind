conclusion:
  summary: |
    Phase 8F has successfully addressed the critical monorepo limitation at its core.
    The repository discovery now correctly identifies repository roots and calculates
    subdirectory paths. The implementation quality is excellent with proper use of
    git commands, comprehensive error handling, and professional code patterns.
    
    However, the phase is only 40% complete. The remaining 60% focuses on subdirectory
    filtering for commits, which is essential for the feature to be production-ready.
    This must be completed before resuming Swift Phase 3 to ensure proper git
    integration in monorepo scenarios.
  
  grade: "A- (for completed portions)"
  recommendation: "CONTINUE TO COMPLETION"
  blocking_status: "Still blocking Swift Phase 3 until filtering implemented"
  next_milestone: "Implement subdirectory filtering for commits"
