conclusion:
  summary: |
    The Settings persistence and Project path configurability enhancements represent
    a significant step toward professional application behavior. Users now have:
    
    1. Persistent settings that survive app restarts
    2. Configurable project paths for multi-project workflows  
    3. Customizable auto-start and notification preferences
    4. Professional-grade Node.js process launching
    
    The implementation demonstrates excellent Swift patterns including reactive
    programming with @Published properties, UserDefaults integration with didSet
    observers, and comprehensive first-run handling.
