  summary: |
    Phase 2 implementation has been ENHANCED beyond initial requirements.
    Post-review improvements have addressed key weaknesses in error handling,
    performance, and documentation. The application now has:
    
    - Professional error handling ready for Phase 3 MCP integration
    - Optimized search with debouncing to prevent API overload
    - Well-documented code following Swift best practices
    - Maintained excellent UI polish and animations
    
    The codebase exceeds Phase 2 expectations and provides a solid
    foundation for Phase 3 with minimal technical debt.

recommendation: "PROCEED TO TESTING with confidence, then Phase 3 MCP integration"
