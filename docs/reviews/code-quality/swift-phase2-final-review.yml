## Final Assessment

overall_evaluation:
  grade: "B+"
  phase_2_success: true
  production_ready: false
  testing_ready: true
  
  summary: |
    Phase 2 implementation is EXCELLENT for a static UI prototype. All visual
    elements are in place, matching the original mockups with professional
    polish. The window management solution is innovative and works well.
    
    The codebase is clean, well-organized, and ready for Phase 3 integration.
    The architecture will support MCP integration without major refactoring.
    
    Key achievement: Resolved all build issues and created a stable, visually
    appealing macOS menu bar application ready for real functionality.

recommendation: "PROCEED TO TESTING, then begin Phase 3 MCP integration"
