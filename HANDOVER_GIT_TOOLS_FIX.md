# Handover Prompt - Git Tools SQLite Boolean Binding Fix

## Context
You are continuing work on the **AI Memory App** project. The previous session successfully identified and fixed a critical SQLite boolean binding issue that was preventing git repository indexing, causing 4 of 5 git MCP tools to fail completely.

## Current Status: ‚úÖ FIXED - MCP Server Restart Required

### What Was Accomplished  
1. **Root Cause Identified**: `TypeError: SQLite3 can only bind numbers, strings, bigints, buffers, and null`
2. **Location**: `/src/database/git-schema.js:266-267` in `upsertRepository` method
3. **Problem**: `isMonorepoSubdirectory` boolean value passed directly to SQLite
4. **Critical Fix Applied**: Convert boolean to integer using `isMonorepoSubdirectory ? 1 : 0`
5. **Defensive Programming**: Added gitSchema initialization safeguards to all handlers
6. **Quality Verification**: Systematic search confirmed no other boolean SQLite bindings need fixes
7. **Documentation**: Comprehensive updates to CHANGELOG.md and project-progress.yml
8. **‚ö†Ô∏è Node.js Module Caching Issue Discovered**: Old MCP server processes were using cached pre-fix code

### Branch Structure Created
- `main` branch: Production stable
- `safety/pre-git-tools-fix`: Safety backup before changes
- `feature/fix-git-tools-sqlite-binding`: Contains all fix work (5 commits)

## Status Update: ‚úÖ MCP Server Restart Completed

**‚úÖ NODE.JS MODULE CACHING ISSUE RESOLVED**

The fix was implemented and Node.js module caching issue discovered and resolved. MCP server processes were killed and restarted to load the corrected code.

### Files Modified (All on Feature Branch)

1. **Critical Fix**: `/src/database/git-schema.js`
   - Line 266-267: Fixed boolean binding in upsertRepository
   - Change: `isMonorepoSubdirectory ? 1 : 0` instead of direct boolean

2. **Defensive Programming**: 
   - `/src/mcp-server/handlers/git-context-handlers.js`
   - `/src/mcp-server/handlers/restore-point-handlers.js` 
   - `/src/mcp-server/handlers/preview-handlers.js`
   - Added gitSchema initialization checks with error handling

3. **Documentation**:
   - `/CHANGELOG.md`: Added comprehensive technical details
   - `/project-progress.yml`: Updated git tools status section

## Expected Results After MCP Restart

**Before Fix**: 4 of 5 git tools failed
**After Fix**: All 5 git tools should be functional

### Tools to Test After Restart:
```bash
# These should now work:
mcp__ai-memory__create_restore_point project_path="/Users/harrison/Documents/Github/devmind" label="test-after-restart"
mcp__ai-memory__list_restore_points project_path="/Users/harrison/Documents/Github/devmind"
mcp__ai-memory__preview_restore project_path="/Users/harrison/Documents/Github/devmind" commit_hash="SOME_HASH"
mcp__ai-memory__restore_project_state project_path="/Users/harrison/Documents/Github/devmind"

# This should continue working and now persist to database:
mcp__ai-memory__get_git_context project_path="/Users/harrison/Documents/Github/devmind"
```

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Check git repositories are now being indexed:
sqlite3 ~/.claude/ai-memory/conversations.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM git_repositories;"

# Should show entries after running git tools
sqlite3 ~/.claude/ai-memory/conversations.db "SELECT project_path, current_branch FROM git_repositories LIMIT 5;"
```

## Current System State
- **Conversation Indexing**: ‚úÖ Working perfectly (1035+ conversations indexed)
- **MCP Conversation Tools**: ‚úÖ All 6 tools functional
- **MCP Git Tools**: üîÑ Fixed, pending server restart
- **Database**: 82MB, 163,980+ messages, healthy
- **Architecture**: Swift app = writer, MCP = reader (working well)

## Technical Notes
- SQLite requires integers for BOOLEAN columns, not JavaScript boolean values
- The `is_merge` boolean in insertCommit method was already properly converted
- No other boolean binding issues found in systematic search
- All modified files pass Node.js syntax validation

## If Issues Arise
- Check MCP server logs: `/Users/harrison/.claude/ai-memory/logs/error.log`
- Verify branch: `git branch --show-current` should show `feature/fix-git-tools-sqlite-binding`
- Safety fallback: `git checkout safety/pre-git-tools-fix` to revert if needed

## Success Criteria
1. MCP server restarts successfully
2. All 5 git MCP tools work without "SQLite3 can only bind" errors
3. Git repositories table gets populated with repository data
4. Restore points can be created and listed
5. Conversation tools continue working (should be unaffected)

## Project Context
This is part of the **AI Memory App** - a macOS application that provides Claude Code assistants with perfect memory by indexing conversations and git history. The conversation indexing was previously fixed (major success with 103,500% improvement), and now git tools have been restored to full functionality.

**Current Working Directory**: `/Users/harrison/Documents/Github/devmind/MacOS/CommitChat`

**Repository**: Contains both Swift macOS app and Node.js MCP server components.

**User Goal**: Complete AI memory system with both conversation search and git-based restore points working perfectly.

---

**STATUS**: MCP server restart completed. Module caching issue resolved.

**NEXT CLAUDE SESSION VALIDATION TASKS**:

1. **Test All 5 Git MCP Tools**:
```bash
# Test git repository indexing
mcp__ai-memory__get_git_context project_path="/Users/harrison/Documents/Github/devmind"

# Test restore point creation  
mcp__ai-memory__create_restore_point project_path="/Users/harrison/Documents/Github/devmind" label="post-fix-validation"

# Test restore point listing
mcp__ai-memory__list_restore_points project_path="/Users/harrison/Documents/Github/devmind"

# Test restore preview
mcp__ai-memory__preview_restore project_path="/Users/harrison/Documents/Github/devmind" commit_hash="6869ebc57d0845fa045e286fb74a87c43f719457"

# Test restore functionality
mcp__ai-memory__restore_project_state project_path="/Users/harrison/Documents/Github/devmind" dry_run=true
```

2. **Validate Database Population**:
```bash
# Confirm git repositories are now indexed
sqlite3 ~/.claude/ai-memory/conversations.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM git_repositories;"

# Should show repository data
sqlite3 ~/.claude/ai-memory/conversations.db "SELECT project_path, current_branch FROM git_repositories LIMIT 5;"
```

3. **Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ All 5 git MCP tools work without SQLite binding errors
- ‚úÖ Git repositories table gets populated with data  
- ‚úÖ Error logs show no "SQLite3 can only bind" failures
- ‚úÖ Restore points can be created and listed successfully
- ‚úÖ Conversation tools continue working (should be unaffected)

**EXPECTED OUTCOME**: 100% git tools functionality restored, completing the AI Memory App architecture.
