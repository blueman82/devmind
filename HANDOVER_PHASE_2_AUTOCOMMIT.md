# Continue Phase 2: Auto-Commit Functionality Implementation for AI Memory App

## Context
You are continuing work on the **AI Memory App (CommitChat)** - a Swift macOS application that indexes Claude Code conversations and will implement auto-commit functionality with shadow branches. The previous session completed comprehensive planning for Phase 2.

## Current Status
- **Phase 1**: âœ… COMPLETE - All git tools working (5/5 operational after SQLite boolean binding fix)
- **Phase 2**: ðŸ“‹ FULLY PLANNED - Ready for implementation
- **Current Branch**: `feature/fix-git-tools-sqlite-binding` (can create new branch for Phase 2)
- **Conversation Indexing**: âœ… Working - 1035+ conversations indexed
- **Git Tools**: âœ… All 5 MCP tools operational

## Your Task: Begin Phase 2 Implementation

### Phase 2 Overview
Implement auto-commit functionality that creates commits on shadow branches for every file save, enriched with Claude Code conversation context when available.

### Core Architecture - The Single-Check Principle
```yaml
on_file_save:
  1. FSEvents detects change
  2. Check: Is there a match in user-configured project path?
     - If YES â†’ Use conversation context for commit message
     - If NO â†’ Use git diff analysis
  3. Commit to shadow/[branch-name]
```

### Key Implementation Details

**Shadow Branches**: 
- Pattern: `shadow/main`, `shadow/feature-xyz`
- User's branches stay clean
- Complete history preserved

**Conversation Detection**:
- Search location is **already configurable** in UI (`MCPServerSettingsView.swift` lines 34-40)
- Use `appState.projectPath` instead of hardcoding `~/.claude/projects`
- Look for Edit/Write tool_use events within 10 seconds

**Critical Features to Implement**:
1. **Sensitive File Detection** - Scan for API keys, passwords before committing
2. **SQLite WAL Mode** - Enable concurrent access (Swift app + MCP server)
3. **UNUserNotificationCenter** - macOS notifications for auto-commits
4. **Repository Management UI** - Enable/disable per repository

### Week 1 Tasks (Phase 2a - Foundation)
1. Enable SQLite WAL mode across the application
2. Create database schema for new tables:
   - `shadow_commits`
   - `conversation_git_correlations`
   - `repository_settings`
3. Implement shadow branch creation logic
4. Set up basic FSEvents file monitoring

### Important Files and Locations
- **Phase 2 Plan**: `/docs/PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (complete implementation guide)
- **Swift App**: `/MacOS/CommitChat/` 
- **MCP Server**: `/src/mcp-server/`
- **Database**: `~/.claude/ai-memory/conversations.db`
- **Project Progress**: `/project-progress.yml` (contains all architectural decisions)

### Technical Decisions Already Made
- Shadow branches over direct commits
- Single-check architecture (not complex correlation)
- Rich commit messages when context available, diff-based otherwise
- 2-second throttle between commits
- 10MB file size limit (configurable)
- Sensitive file detection required for security

### Success Criteria for Week 1
- [ ] SQLite WAL mode working (test concurrent access)
- [ ] Shadow branch created successfully on first auto-commit
- [ ] FSEvents detecting file saves in monitored repositories
- [ ] Basic auto-commit working to shadow branch (even with simple messages)

### Architecture Evolution (Important Context)
The Phase 2 plan evolved through several iterations:
1. **v1**: Complex JSONL correlation with timing windows (too complicated)
2. **v2**: Claude installation detection (too simplistic)
3. **v3**: Session activity monitoring (still complex)
4. **v4 Final**: Single check in project path (elegant and simple)

This evolution is documented in `project-progress.yml` - we're building v4.

### Questions to Answer Early
1. Should we create a new feature branch for Phase 2 work?
2. Test the existing Project Path configuration in the UI - does it persist correctly?
3. Verify FSEvents permissions on macOS (may need user authorization)

### Competitive Context
We're building a better alternative to **ShadowGit** with our unique advantages:
- Shadow branches (ShadowGit commits to current branch)
- Conversation context enrichment (our killer feature)
- Native macOS app with better performance
- Bidirectional search: conversationâ†’code and codeâ†’conversation

### Implementation Warnings
1. **Database Lock**: Swift app might lock database while indexing - implement WAL mode early
2. **FSEvents Permissions**: May need user authorization on macOS
3. **Sensitive Files**: Never auto-commit detected API keys or passwords
4. **Module Caching**: After code changes, restart MCP server to clear Node.js cache

### Next Steps
1. Read `/docs/PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for full details
2. Check current git status and create Phase 2 branch if needed
3. Start with SQLite WAL mode implementation
4. Test concurrent database access between Swift app and MCP server

### Testing Approach
- Start with single repository monitoring
- Use test project with known file changes
- Verify shadow branch creation
- Check commit message generation (both with and without Claude context)

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Create new Phase 2 branch
git checkout -b feature/phase-2-auto-commit

# Test MCP server connection
mcp__ai-memory__health_check

# Check database for new tables (after creating them)
sqlite3 ~/.claude/ai-memory/conversations.db ".tables"

# Monitor FSEvents (for debugging)
fswatch -v /path/to/test/repo
```

**Note**: The Project Path in the UI is already configurable, giving users flexibility to point to their Claude projects wherever they're stored. This is better than the hardcoded path we originally planned.

**Resources**: All architectural decisions, timeline, and implementation details are in the Phase 2 plan document. The evolution from complex correlation to simple single-check architecture is documented in `project-progress.yml`.

**Session Summary**: Previous session completed all Phase 2 planning, resolved architectural questions, and prepared comprehensive implementation guide. Ready to begin Week 1 of Phase 2 implementation!
