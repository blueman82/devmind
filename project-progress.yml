      - "✅ Elasticsearch MCP supports full query DSL"
      - "✅ Semantic search through neural embeddings available"
    current_limitations:
      - "❌ Rigid AND logic (langgraph + ketchup = 1 result)"

    search_modes:
      - "✅ Mixed mode: exact matching with fuzzy fallback"
      - "✅ Configurable fuzzy threshold (0.0-1.0)"
      - "✅ Enhanced results include relevanceScore and matchedTerms"
    known_limitations:
      - "⚠️ Fuzzy search needs refinement for some edge cases"
      - "⚠️ Very tolerant fuzzy thresholds may need optimization"
  
  pagination_implementation:

      - "✅ Summary modes (full, condensed, key_points_only)"
      - "✅ Priority message inclusion (first, last, errors, important)"
      - "✅ Long message exclusion option (>1000 characters)"
      - "✅ Automatic token limiting respects both page size and max tokens"
    utility_methods_added:

  unified_handler_architecture:

      4. THEN: Strip ANSI codes for pattern matching
      5. THEN: Check for startup patterns and update status
    benefits:
      - "No more handler conflicts - only ONE handler per FileHandle"
      - "MCPClient gets raw JSON-RPC data without ANSI interference"
      - "Pattern matching still works with ANSI stripping"

  technical_solutions_implemented:
    database_unification:
      approach: "Single shared database instead of separate databases"
      result: "Swift app now accesses 591+ conversations with 400k+ messages"
