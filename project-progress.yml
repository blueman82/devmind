## Phase 6: Enhanced Search Implementation ✅
search_enhancements:
  status: "COMPLETED"
  date_completed: "2025-08-30"

  motivation: "User feedback revealed rigid AND-based search limiting utility"
  research_findings:
    mcp_capabilities:
      - "✅ Fuzzy search possible (Icon MCP uses Fuse.js)"
      - "✅ Elasticsearch MCP supports full query DSL"
      - "✅ Semantic search through neural embeddings available"
    current_limitations:
      - "❌ Rigid AND logic (langgraph + ketchup = 1 result)"
      - "❌ No fuzzy tolerance for typos/variations"
      - "❌ No OR search capability"
  completed_improvements:
    - "✅ PRD updated with fuzzy search specifications"
    - "✅ Enhanced conversation parser with fuzzy matching and relevance scoring"
    - "✅ OR logic implementation for flexible queries (default OR vs old AND)"
    - "✅ Configurable search thresholds and modes (fuzzy/exact/mixed)"
    - "✅ MCP server enhanced with new search parameters"
    - "✅ Query parsing for quoted phrases and individual terms"
    - "✅ Levenshtein-based string similarity algorithm"

    or_logic_success:
      - "✅ 'langgraph' now finds 87 conversations (vs 1 with old AND logic)"
      - "✅ 'authentication implementation' finds 3 conversations with flexible matching"
      - "✅ Multi-term queries now use OR by default for better utility"
    search_modes:
      - "✅ Mixed mode: exact matching with fuzzy fallback"
      - "✅ Configurable fuzzy threshold (0.0-1.0)"
      - "✅ Enhanced results include relevanceScore and matchedTerms"
    known_limitations:
      - "⚠️ Fuzzy search needs refinement for some edge cases"
      - "⚠️ Very tolerant fuzzy thresholds may need optimization"
  
  pagination_implementation:
    motivation: "Large conversations (57,024 tokens) exceeded 25,000 token limit in get_conversation_context"
    completed_features:
      - "✅ Smart pagination with page/page_size parameters"
      - "✅ Token estimation algorithm (1 token ≈ 4 characters)"
      - "✅ Content type filtering (user, assistant, tool_calls, tool_results)"
      - "✅ Summary modes (full, condensed, key_points_only)"
      - "✅ Priority message inclusion (first, last, errors, important)"
      - "✅ Long message exclusion option (>1000 characters)"
      - "✅ Automatic token limiting respects both page size and max tokens"
    utility_methods_added:
      - "estimateTokens(text): Token counting approximation"
      - "filterMessages(messages, options): Content type filtering"
      - "getMessageText(msg): Safe text extraction"
      - "formatMessage(msg, summaryMode): Message compression"
      - "paginateMessages(messages, page, pageSize, maxTokens): Smart chunking"
    testing_results:
      - "✅ 57,024 token conversation successfully chunked to <20k tokens"
      - "✅ Page-based navigation maintains conversation context"
      - "✅ Content filtering reduces noise in large conversations"
      - "✅ Summary modes provide appropriate compression levels"

# CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE DISCOVERY

  status: "🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED"
  
  current_wrong_architecture:
    flow: "Mac app → MCP Client → ai-memory MCP server → SQLite"
    problems:
      - "Mac app making slow JSON-RPC calls for local data"
      - "Network overhead for what should be local operations"
      - "External dependency for core functionality"
      - "Performance bottleneck by design"
      
  correct_architecture_per_prd:
    flow: "External tools → MCP → Mac app (local data owner)"
    design_principle: "Mac app builds the data, MCP talks to it"
    benefits:
      - "Fast local database access for Mac app UI"
      - "Mac app owns and controls its conversation data"
      - "MCP serves as API layer for external tool access"
      - "No network overhead for local operations"

    performance_gain_potential: "10x+ improvement for local operations"
    
  next_steps_required:
    priority_1: "Implement local conversation database in Mac app"
    priority_2: "Create MCP server that queries Mac app's local data"
    priority_3: "Remove external MCP dependency for core UI operations"
    
  impact_assessment:
    current_session_work: "Fixed symptoms but not root cause"
    architecture_redesign: "Required for proper performance and design"

## Phase 36: Critical Architecture Redesign 🚨
architecture_redesign:
  status: "IN_PROGRESS"
  date_started: "2025-09-02"
  critical_discovery: "Mac app architecture is inverted - making network calls for local data"
  
  problem_identified:

    correct_pattern: "Mac App → Local SQLite + MCP Server queries Mac App"

    root_cause: "Mac app is client when it should be data owner"
    
  implementation_progress:
    completed:
      - "✅ Discovered architecture inversion issue"
      - "✅ Created AIMemoryDataModel.swift with local SQLite implementation"
      - "✅ Implemented local database operations replacing MCP calls"
      - "✅ Added proper SQLite table creation and indexing"
      - "✅ Converted from Core Data to direct SQLite for better control"

    - "Mac app owns and controls conversation data per PRD"
    - "MCP becomes external API layer for other tools"
    - "10x+ performance improvement for UI operations"
    - "Commercial viability restored with proper architecture"
  
  competitor_analysis:

      - "We link conversations to git commits (unique value)"
      - "Combined context: AI knows what you DISCUSSED and BUILT"
      - "Broader scope than just git tracking"
    
  revised_architecture_decision:
    keep_as_is:
      - "Git tools remain in MCP server (already built and working)"
      - "MCP handles git operations via existing handlers"
    
    must_change:
      - "Mac app must use local SQLite directly (not via MCP)"
      - "Mac app needs FSEvents for conversation indexing"
      - "Mac app needs automatic git tracking (like ShadowGit)"
    
    competitive_strategy:
      - "Match ShadowGit's auto-commit feature"
