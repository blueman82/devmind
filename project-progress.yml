# AI Memory App - Development Progress Tracker

project:
  name: "AI Memory App"
  description: "macOS app that indexes Claude Code conversations and git history, providing AI assistants with perfect memory"

  findings:
    - "Claude Code stores conversations in ~/.claude/projects/ as JSONL files"
    - "JSONL format contains all needed data: sessionId, projectPath, messages, timestamps"
    - "Real data validation: 88 conversations about 'authentication', 217 about 'ketchup'"
    - "Project path mapping works correctly via 'cwd' field"
    - "Parser successfully extracts tool calls, file references, and content"

## File Structure
files_created:
  core_documents:
    - "AI-Memory-App-PRD.md"          # Product requirements
    - "ai-memory-app-mockups.html"    # UI mockups
    - "project-progress.yml"          # This progress tracker
  
  proof_of_concept:
    - "conversation-parser.js"        # JSONL parser and search
    - "package.json"                  # Node.js dependencies
    - "mcp-server.js"                 # MCP server implementation
  
  planned:
    - "src/"                          # Source code organization
    - "tests/"                        # Test files
    - "docs/"                         # Documentation
    - "scripts/"                      # Build and utility scripts

## Next Steps
immediate_todos:
  - "Create proper git branches (safety, investigation, development)"
  - "Stash current work and organize into proper folder structure"
  - "Complete MCP server tool implementations"
  - "Test MCP integration with Claude Code"
  - "Create basic Swift macOS app structure"

## Technical Discoveries
discoveries:
  claude_code_data:
    - "Conversations stored in: ~/.claude/projects/{hash}/{sessionId}.jsonl"
    - "Each line is JSON with: uuid, sessionId, timestamp, type, message"
    - "Message content array contains: text, tool_use, tool_result objects"
    - "Project path available in 'cwd' field of messages"
    - "File references extractable from tool_use inputs"
  
  challenges_solved:
    - "‚úÖ Tool result content type handling (string vs object)"
    - "‚úÖ File path extraction from tool calls"
    - "‚úÖ Search functionality across conversations"
    - "‚úÖ Project discovery and correlation"
