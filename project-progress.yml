  issue_source: "docs/git-integration-review.yml - LOW severity warning"
  
  problem_addressed:
    issue: "Repository cache with 5-minute TTL serving stale data"
    impact: "Branch changes or new commits not reflected immediately"

      - "Git operations are fast enough for 30-second cache"
      - "User branch switches reflected within 30 seconds"
      - "Minimal performance impact on typical usage"
