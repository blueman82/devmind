## Technical Discoveries
discoveries:
  claude_code_data:
    - "Conversations stored in: ~/.claude/projects/{hash}/{sessionId}.jsonl"
    - "Each line is JSON with: uuid, sessionId, timestamp, type, message"
    - "Message content array contains: text, tool_use, tool_result objects"
    - "Project path available in 'cwd' field of messages"
    - "File references extractable from tool_use inputs"
  
  challenges_solved:
    - "✅ Tool result content type handling (string vs object)"
    - "✅ File path extraction from tool calls"
    - "✅ Search functionality across conversations"
    - "✅ Project discovery and correlation"
