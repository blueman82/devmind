## Phase 6: Enhanced Search Implementation ✅
search_enhancements:
  status: "COMPLETED"
  date_completed: "2025-08-30"
  date_started: "2025-08-30"
  motivation: "User feedback revealed rigid AND-based search limiting utility"
  research_findings:
    mcp_capabilities:
      - "✅ Fuzzy search possible (Icon MCP uses Fuse.js)"
      - "✅ Elasticsearch MCP supports full query DSL"
      - "✅ Semantic search through neural embeddings available"
    current_limitations:
      - "❌ Rigid AND logic (langgraph + ketchup = 1 result)"
      - "❌ No fuzzy tolerance for typos/variations"
      - "❌ No OR search capability"
  completed_improvements:
    - "✅ PRD updated with fuzzy search specifications"
    - "✅ Enhanced conversation parser with fuzzy matching and relevance scoring"
    - "✅ OR logic implementation for flexible queries (default OR vs old AND)"
    - "✅ Configurable search thresholds and modes (fuzzy/exact/mixed)"
    - "✅ MCP server enhanced with new search parameters"
    - "✅ Query parsing for quoted phrases and individual terms"
    - "✅ Levenshtein-based string similarity algorithm"
  testing_results:
    or_logic_success:
      - "✅ 'langgraph' now finds 87 conversations (vs 1 with old AND logic)"
      - "✅ 'authentication implementation' finds 3 conversations with flexible matching"
      - "✅ Multi-term queries now use OR by default for better utility"
    search_modes:
      - "✅ Mixed mode: exact matching with fuzzy fallback"
      - "✅ Configurable fuzzy threshold (0.0-1.0)"
      - "✅ Enhanced results include relevanceScore and matchedTerms"
    known_limitations:
      - "⚠️ Fuzzy search needs refinement for some edge cases"
      - "⚠️ Very tolerant fuzzy thresholds may need optimization"
  
  pagination_implementation:
    motivation: "Large conversations (57,024 tokens) exceeded 25,000 token limit in get_conversation_context"
    completed_features:
      - "✅ Smart pagination with page/page_size parameters"
      - "✅ Token estimation algorithm (1 token ≈ 4 characters)"
      - "✅ Content type filtering (user, assistant, tool_calls, tool_results)"
      - "✅ Summary modes (full, condensed, key_points_only)"
      - "✅ Priority message inclusion (first, last, errors, important)"
      - "✅ Long message exclusion option (>1000 characters)"
      - "✅ Automatic token limiting respects both page size and max tokens"
    utility_methods_added:
      - "estimateTokens(text): Token counting approximation"
      - "filterMessages(messages, options): Content type filtering"
      - "getMessageText(msg): Safe text extraction"
      - "formatMessage(msg, summaryMode): Message compression"
      - "paginateMessages(messages, page, pageSize, maxTokens): Smart chunking"
    testing_results:
      - "✅ 57,024 token conversation successfully chunked to <20k tokens"
      - "✅ Page-based navigation maintains conversation context"
      - "✅ Content filtering reduces noise in large conversations"
      - "✅ Summary modes provide appropriate compression levels"
