    issue: "Repository cache with 5-minute TTL serving stale data"
    impact: "Branch changes or new commits not reflected immediately"
    user_experience: "After switching branches, MCP shows old branch for up to 5 minutes"
    
  solution_implemented:
    approach: "Reduced cache TTL from 5 minutes to 30 seconds"
    location: "src/git/git-manager.js:23"
    rationale:
      - "Balances performance with data freshness"
      - "Git operations are fast enough for 30-second cache"
      - "User branch switches reflected within 30 seconds"
      - "Minimal performance impact on typical usage"
    
  alternatives_considered:
    remove_cache: "Too much performance impact"
    smart_invalidation: "Over-engineering for current needs"
    1_minute_ttl: "Still too long for active development"
    
  validation: "Cache still provides performance benefit while ensuring fresh data"
