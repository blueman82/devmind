# Swift macOS App Implementation Progress

## CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW THROUGHOUT IMPLEMENTATION

development_rules:
  rule_1: "‚úÖ COMMIT AFTER EVERY CHANGE"
    enforcement: "MANDATORY - No exceptions, every modification gets committed immediately"
    purpose: "Maintain audit trail and enable easy rollback if needed"
    
  rule_2: "‚úÖ UPDATE swift-app-implementation-progress.yml AFTER EVERY CHANGE" 
    enforcement: "MANDATORY - This document must reflect current implementation status"
    purpose: "Track progress, maintain synchronization between planning and reality"
    
  rule_3: "‚úÖ KEEP CODE FILES AROUND ~500 LINES"
    enforcement: "MANDATORY - Split files when approaching this limit"
    purpose: "Maintain readability, modularity, and compliance with project standards"
    reference: "Learned from git-tool-handlers.js incident (1534 lines violation)"
    
  rule_4: "‚úÖ ENSURE WE HAVE TEST COVERAGE"
    enforcement: "MANDATORY - Write tests for all non-trivial functionality" 
    purpose: "Maintain code quality and prevent regressions"
    approach: "Unit tests for models/services, UI tests for critical user flows"
    
  rule_5: "‚úÖ USE CONTEXT7 FOR SWIFT/SWIFTUI ASSISTANCE"
    resource: "context7 provides 5767+ Swift code snippets and 15,469+ SwiftUI examples"
    usage: "Query context7 when stuck on syntax, patterns, or implementation details"
    
  rule_6: "‚úÖ USE AI-MEMORY MCP FOR CONTEXT AND REFERENCE"
    resource: "ai-memory MCP server provides context about our existing tools and implementation"
    usage: "Query MCP tools to understand data structures, API patterns, and integration points"
    tools_available: "search_conversations, get_conversation_context, list_restore_points, etc."

compliance_tracking:
  violations_allowed: 0
  current_violations: 0
  enforcement_level: "STRICT - No flexibility on these rules"
  
historical_context:
  previous_violation: "git-tool-handlers.js reached 1534 lines (307% over limit)"
  lesson_learned: "File size violations create technical debt and compliance issues"
  resolution: "Emergency refactoring split into 6 focused modules under 500 lines"
  outcome: "All functionality preserved, 33/33 tests still passing"

## Risk Assessment

technical_risks:
  mcp_integration_complexity:
    risk: "Process management and IPC may be complex in Swift"
    mitigation: "Start with simple JSON over stdin/stdout, expand as needed"
    
  swiftui_limitations:
    risk: "SwiftUI may have limitations for complex interfaces"
    mitigation: "Existing Context7 research shows MenuBarExtra patterns work well"
    
  performance_concerns:
    risk: "Real-time updates may impact performance"
    mitigation: "Leverage existing optimized MCP server performance"

business_risks:
  development_timeline:
    risk: "Swift learning curve may extend timeline"
    mitigation: "Extensive Context7 resources and documentation available"
    
  user_adoption:
    risk: "Users may prefer CLI/MCP interface"
    mitigation: "GUI provides additional value, doesn't replace existing interface"

## Development Philosophy

implementation_principles:
  - "Leverage existing backend - don't reinvent the wheel"
  - "Start simple, iterate quickly"
  - "Match UI mockups closely for consistent user experience"  
  - "Maintain separation between UI (Swift) and logic (Node.js)"
  - "Follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines"
  - "Ensure accessibility and native macOS behavior"

quality_standards:
  code_organization: "Clear separation of concerns with Services/Views/Models"
  error_handling: "Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages"
  performance: "Responsive UI with background processing for MCP calls"
  testing: "Unit tests for models and services, UI testing for critical flows"
  documentation: "Clear inline documentation and README for maintenance"

## Project Integration

parent_project_status:
  current_phase: "Phase 8E - Swift macOS App Development" 
  integration_point: "Extends existing MCP server with native macOS interface"
  deployment: "Standalone .app bundle that launches MCP server as subprocess"
  user_experience: "Seamless - users get GUI interface while retaining CLI/MCP access"
