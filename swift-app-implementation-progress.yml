# Swift macOS App Implementation Progress

## CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW THROUGHOUT IMPLEMENTATION

development_rules:
  rule_1: "‚úÖ COMMIT AFTER EVERY CHANGE"
    enforcement: "MANDATORY - No exceptions, every modification gets committed immediately"
    purpose: "Maintain audit trail and enable easy rollback if needed"
    
  rule_2: "‚úÖ UPDATE swift-app-implementation-progress.yml AFTER EVERY CHANGE" 
    enforcement: "MANDATORY - This document must reflect current implementation status"
    purpose: "Track progress, maintain synchronization between planning and reality"
    
  rule_3: "‚úÖ KEEP CODE FILES AROUND ~500 LINES"
    enforcement: "MANDATORY - Split files when approaching this limit"
    purpose: "Maintain readability, modularity, and compliance with project standards"
    reference: "Learned from git-tool-handlers.js incident (1534 lines violation)"
    
  rule_4: "‚úÖ ENSURE WE HAVE TEST COVERAGE"
    enforcement: "MANDATORY - Write tests for all non-trivial functionality" 
    purpose: "Maintain code quality and prevent regressions"
    approach: "Unit tests for models/services, UI tests for critical user flows"
    
  rule_5: "‚úÖ USE CONTEXT7 FOR SWIFT/SWIFTUI ASSISTANCE"
    resource: "context7 provides 5767+ Swift code snippets and 15,469+ SwiftUI examples"
    usage: "Query context7 when stuck on syntax, patterns, or implementation details"
    
  rule_6: "‚úÖ USE AI-MEMORY MCP FOR CONTEXT AND REFERENCE"
    resource: "ai-memory MCP server provides context about our existing tools and implementation"
    usage: "Query MCP tools to understand data structures, API patterns, and integration points"
    tools_available: "search_conversations, get_conversation_context, list_restore_points, etc."

compliance_tracking:
  violations_allowed: 0
  current_violations: 0
  enforcement_level: "STRICT - No flexibility on these rules"
  
historical_context:
  previous_violation: "git-tool-handlers.js reached 1534 lines (307% over limit)"
  lesson_learned: "File size violations create technical debt and compliance issues"
  resolution: "Emergency refactoring split into 6 focused modules under 500 lines"
  outcome: "All functionality preserved, 33/33 tests still passing"

## Risk Assessment

technical_risks:
  mcp_integration_complexity:
    risk: "Process management and IPC may be complex in Swift"
    mitigation: "Start with simple JSON over stdin/stdout, expand as needed"
    
  swiftui_limitations:
    risk: "SwiftUI may have limitations for complex interfaces"
    mitigation: "Existing Context7 research shows MenuBarExtra patterns work well"
    
  performance_concerns:

      package_url: "https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb"
      pros:
        - "Production-proven in thousands of iOS apps"
        - "Similar API to raw SQLite3"
        - "Extensive documentation and examples"
        - "Bundles modern SQLite version"
        - "Minimal refactoring required"
      cons:
        - "Objective-C bridging overhead"
        - "Less type-safe than pure Swift"
      effort_estimate: "1-2 days refactoring"
  
  implementation_plan:
    step_1: "Research and choose between SQLite.swift and FMDB"
    step_2: "Add chosen library to Xcode project via Swift Package Manager"
    step_3: "Create new database model class using library API"
    step_4: "Refactor AIMemoryDataModel.swift to use new library"
    step_5: "Test bulk conversation insertion without corruption"
    step_6: "Verify all MCP integration still works"
    step_7: "Performance testing and validation"
  
  current_progress:
    step_1_research: "‚úÖ COMPLETED - SQLite.swift 0.15.4 chosen over FMDB"
    step_1_decision_rationale: "Active maintenance, modern Swift patterns, type safety"
    ultrathink_analysis: "‚úÖ COMPLETED - Found corruption source in bulk INSERT loop (lines 539-567)"
    corruption_location: "indexConversation method, message insertion for-loop"
    setup_documentation: "‚úÖ COMPLETED - Created SQLITE_SWIFT_SETUP.md with Xcode instructions"
    setup_instructions_enhanced: "‚úÖ COMPLETED - Updated with horse/cart ordering and critical clarifications"
    sqlite_swift_implementation: "‚úÖ COMPLETED - Created SQLiteSwiftDataModel.swift with corruption fix"
    critical_clarification: "‚úÖ IDENTIFIED - import SQLite (package) vs import SQLite3 (system) distinction"
    compilation_blocker: "‚ö†Ô∏è IDENTIFIED - Cannot compile without adding SQLite.swift package to Xcode first"
    correct_implementation_order: "üê¥ HORSE: Add package to Xcode, üõí CART: Test implementation, üéØ GOAL: Verify corruption elimination"
    
  implementation_status:
    corruption_fix_code: "‚úÖ WRITTEN - SQLiteSwiftDataModel.swift eliminates raw SQLite3 calls"
    package_dependency: "‚ùå NOT ADDED - SQLite.swift package not in Xcode project yet"
    compilation_status: "‚ùå WILL FAIL - import SQLite requires package installation"
    testing_status: "‚ùå BLOCKED - Cannot test until compilation works"
  
  success_criteria:
    corruption_elimination: "Zero 'line 106515' errors during bulk operations"
    data_integrity: "All conversations stored reliably in app database"
    mcp_compatibility: "MCP server can still query app database successfully"
    performance_maintained: "No degradation in database operation speed"
    schema_preserved: "Existing INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT schema maintained"
